            <p>Born in New York City on April 4, 1965, Robert Downey Jr. began acting as a young child. He made his first film appearances and was a cast member on Saturday Night Live in the 1980s, but his growing success was marred by years of struggles with drug abuse. Eventually turning his life around, he earned a resurgence of critical and popular acclaim, and is considered one of Hollywood's A-list actors.</p>

            <hr>
            
            <p>Famed actor Robert Downey Jr. was born on April 4, 1965, in New York City, the son of the avant-garde filmmaker Robert Downey Sr., who is best known for the 1969 film Putney Swope. Downey began acting as a young child. His mother, Elsie, was an actress who instilled in her son a love of performing. Raised in Greenwich Village with his older sister, Alison, Downey made his film debut playing a puppy in his father's film, Pound (1970), in which actors played dogs. He would go on to have small parts in several more of his father's films.
                <br>
                Downey's parents divorced when he was 13, and the young actor ended up living in Los Angeles with his father. At the age of 16, however, he dropped out of high school and was on the move again, relocating to New York to live with his mother.</p>

                Despite his troubled history with the law, Downey has a much more stable home life these days. He married producer Susan Levin in 2005, and the couple welcomed their first child together on February 7, 2012. They named their son Exton Elias. On November 4, 2014, Downey and Levin welcomed their second child, a daughter named Avri. In December 2015, California Governor Jerry Brown pardoned Downey for the 1996 drug conviction that sent him to prison for a year.

                One of the people to play a key role in the actor's turnaround was Mel Gibson, with whom Downey co-starred in Air America (1990). Gibson stuck by his friend's side, even as Downey's life was completely unraveling, and when Downey was unable to get something as routine as an insurance bond due to his past troubles with the law, Gibson found him work, casting him in the 2003 film The Singing Detective. The two actors remain close friends today.</p>

            <p>In May 2008, Downey achieved critical acclaim and worldwide box office success for his starring role in <strong>Iron Man</strong> (2008), Jon Favreau's big-screen rendering of the Marvel comic book superhero. The film co-starred Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges and Terrence Howard. In August of 2008, Downey starred with Ben Stiller and Jack Black in the comedy Tropic Thunder (2008), and went on to receive an Academy Award®-nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his, Kirk Lazarus.</p>

            <p>In December 2009, Downey starred in the action-adventure <strong>Sherlock Holmes</strong> (2009). The film, directed by Guy Ritchie, co-starred Jude Law and Rachel McAdams and earned Downey a Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture - Comedy or Musical in January of 2010. Demonstrating he isn't afraid of blockbusters (or English accents), Downey co-starred in the Guy Ritchie directed Sherlock Holmes in 2009, alongside Jude Law as Dr. John Watson. The duo teamed up again for the 2011 sequel, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows.</p>

            <p>Speaking of Hollywood satire, I would call <strong>Tropic Thunder</strong> the absolute funniest film of Robert Downey Jr.'s career for the brutal shots it takes at show business, despite its life in infamy as a result. In particular, I am referring to Downey's controversial performance as a white, Australian, prima donna master thespian who goes full method to play a black man in the Vietnam War-era biopic within the film. This major plot point is one of Tropic Thunder's many understandably offensive gags, yet is also crucial to the film's bold and clever commentary on the ridiculously misguided lengths some actors are willing to go in hopes to achieve recognition which, ironically, earned Downey his second Oscar nomination.</p>

            <p><strong>Chaplin (1992)</strong>
                During what seemed to be the peak of his career at the time, Robert Downey Jr. starred in yet another period piece about a respected figure of the media whose personal life gets in the way of his groundbreaking work. In this case, it is the incomparably influential comedy mastermind Charlie Chaplin, in director Richard Attenborough's dramatization of his meteoric rise as the most recognizable name of the silent film era as the writer, director, and star of classics like The Gold Rush and Modern Times. Although Chaplin is ultimately bogged down by the typical narrative conventions of biopic formula, Downey's stunning, unmistakable portrayal of the film star earned widespread praise from critics and audiences alike, as well as his first Academy Award nomination.</p>
